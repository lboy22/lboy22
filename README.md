<br>Hello, I'm Lucio Beltran. I'm an experienced game developer who has worked on a multitude of projects that can be found and looked through here. This experience ranges from programming core gameplay features to writing, designing, and conceptualizing the narrative aspects of projects while serving as Narrative Designer.<br/>
<br>I have created gameplay mechanics such as freezing everything except the player, an aiming system for PC and mobile projects, UI implementation, score systems, set up animations, created video sequences, and more in the wide variety of projects I have worked on.<br/>
<br/>I have written narratives encompassing new detailed worlds for characters to live in, deep backstories for player and enemy characters that influence the level design of their respective placement, and lore that is incorporated into the art, sound design, and overall focus of these projects.<br/>
